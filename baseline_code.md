# UniClean: A Unified System for Mixed-Error Data Cleaning

This repository contains the implementation and evaluation of **UniClean**, a unified and extensible framework designed to clean large-scale datasets with mixed data errors.

For **baseline methods and benchmark results**, please refer to our baseline repository:

## Overview

UniClean is built to address the challenge of diverse and co-occurring data errors by supporting:
- **Rule-based**, **distribution-based**, and **external knowledge-based** cleaners
- **Flexible composition** and **scalable execution** of cleaning workflows
- A novel **record-level quality evaluation** metric (REDR)

If you are looking for how we compare against state-of-the-art systems and reproduce benchmark baselines, visit the MDCBaseline repository linked above.
