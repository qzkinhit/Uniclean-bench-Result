# UnicleanResult: A Benchmark Repository for Data Cleaning Performance

# Overview
**UnicleanResult** is a repository dedicated to showcasing the performance of Uniclean, a state-of-the-art data cleaning system. While we cannot open source the system code due to commercial confidentiality, this repository provides comprehensive performance metrics and detailed cleaning results, establishing a benchmark for data cleaning. This enables researchers to evaluate and compare the performance of their own cleaning systems on various real-world datasets. The benchmark allows for direct comparisons between Uniclean’s performance, other baseline cleaning systems, and new approaches, offering a standardized framework for assessing data cleaning effectiveness across diverse datasets.

The repository includes:
- **Real-world native datasets** used by Uniclean for testing.
- **Cleaned datasets** that have been processed by Uniclean.
- **Cleaning logs** generated during the Uniclean cleaning process.
- **Baseline performance logs** for comparison with Uniclean’s results.
- An **evaluation script** (`evaluateResult.py`) that calculates various performance metrics, providing an objective assessment of the cleaning effectiveness.

# Running Uniclean’s Cleaning Performance Test

To evaluate Uniclean’s cleaning performance, run the `run.sh` script. This script automates the cleaning process across all datasets and saves performance logs in the `Uniclean_logs/` directory.

## Usage
```bash
# Give execution permissions
chmod +x run.sh

# Run the script
./run.sh
```

The `run.sh` script iterates over each dataset in the `datasets/original_datasets/` directory, processes it with Uniclean, and logs the results. Each dataset has its specific configuration, including `mse_attributes` (attributes for Mean Squared Error calculation) and `elapsed_time` parameters. The results of each dataset’s cleaning process are saved in the corresponding subdirectory within `Uniclean_logs/`.
