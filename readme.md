# UnicleanResult: A Benchmark Repository for Data Cleaning Performance

# Overview
**UnicleanResult** is a repository dedicated to showcasing the performance of Uniclean, a state-of-the-art data cleaning system. While we cannot open source the system code due to commercial confidentiality, this repository provides comprehensive performance metrics and detailed cleaning results, establishing a benchmark for data cleaning. This enables researchers to evaluate and compare the performance of their own cleaning systems on various real-world datasets. The benchmark allows for direct comparisons between Uniclean’s performance, other baseline cleaning systems, and new approaches, offering a standardized framework for assessing data cleaning effectiveness across diverse datasets.

The repository includes:
- **Real-world native datasets** used by Uniclean for testing.
- **Cleaned datasets** that have been processed by Uniclean.
- **Cleaning logs** generated during the Uniclean cleaning process.
- **Baseline performance logs** for comparison with Uniclean’s results.
- An **evaluation script** (`evaluateResult.py`) that calculates various performance metrics, providing an objective assessment of the cleaning effectiveness.

# Important Note on Missing Value Representation

**All CSV files in this repository (clean / dirty / cleaned) use the literal string `empty` to denote missing cells.** It is a placeholder, **not** a meaningful value. When evaluating Uniclean's outputs against your own pipeline, you **must** normalize this token before comparison, otherwise metrics will be misleading.

Recommended pre-processing for any consumer of these files:
```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv(path, keep_default_na=False)
# Treat 'empty' (and other common placeholders) as true missing
df.replace({'empty': '', 'nan': '', 'NULL': '', 'NaN': '', 'None': ''}, inplace=True)
```

Notes:
- The rayyan dataset additionally uses `-1` in `article_jvolumn` / `article_jissue` as a disguised-missing placeholder (kept for backward compatibility with the original release).
- The index column is `index` (integer, 1-based) and aligns row-by-row across `clean_index.csv` / `dirty_index.csv` / `<dataset>_cleaned_by_uniclean.csv`.

# Reproducing Uniclean Results

The pipeline is split into two stages so you can run them independently:

## Stage 1 — Run the cleaning pipeline

```bash
chmod +x uniclean_cleaners/run_clean.sh
./uniclean_cleaners/run_clean.sh
```

What it does:
- Iterates over `1_hospital`, `2_flights`, `3_beers`, `4_rayyan` (defaults; `5_tax` / `6_soccer` are commented out due to ~3h+ runtime each — uncomment in the script to enable).
- Runs the corresponding `uniclean_cleaners/main_<dataset>.py` for each, reading `dirty_index.csv` / `clean_index.csv` from `datasets_and_rules/original_datasets/<dataset>/`.
- Writes the cleaned CSV to `Uniclean_cleaned_data/original_error_cleaned_data/<dataset>_cleaned_by_uniclean.csv`.
- Saves per-dataset stdout/stderr to `Uniclean_cleaner_workflow_logs/original_error_cleaner_workflow_logs/<dataset>/clean_run.log`.
- After cleaning succeeds, automatically invokes `./run.sh` to evaluate the freshly produced cleaned files.

Optional flags:
```bash
./uniclean_cleaners/run_clean.sh hospital flights   # only run a subset
FORCE=1 ./uniclean_cleaners/run_clean.sh            # rerun even if cleaned/result already exists
PYTHON=python3.10 ./uniclean_cleaners/run_clean.sh  # pin a specific interpreter
```

## Stage 2 — Evaluate cleaning performance

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

Reads the cleaned files in `Uniclean_cleaned_data/original_error_cleaned_data/` (either freshly produced by Stage 1, or the prebuilt ones shipped in this repo) and compares against the corresponding `clean_index.csv`. Per-dataset metrics are written to `Uniclean_results/original_error_results/<dataset>/output.log`.

`run.sh` is a thin wrapper around `evaluate_result.py` and can be executed standalone if you only want to re-score existing cleaned files.

## Expected baseline (Uniclean default config)

The metrics below come from running the default scripts on the four primary datasets. Use them as a sanity check after cloning:

| Dataset    | Accuracy | Recall | F1     | EDR    | R-EDR  |
|------------|---------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|
| hospital   | 0.952    | 0.780  | 0.857  | +0.741 | +0.695 |
| flights    | 0.681    | 0.630  | 0.655  | +0.519 | +0.043 |
| beers      | 0.839    | 0.835  | 0.837  | +0.832 | +0.773 |
| rayyan     | 0.938    | 0.905  | 0.922  | +0.900 | +0.883 |

If any EDR drifts more than a few hundredths, double-check that you ran on the `*_index.csv` variants (the same `index` column that's used as the join key during evaluation).

## Running on your own data

Each `main_<dataset>.py` accepts the same set of CLI flags so you can repurpose the cleaners for new datasets:

| Flag              | Default     | Meaning |
|-------------------|-------------|---------|
| `--file_load`     | (per-script) | Path to the dirty CSV |
| `--clean_path`    | (per-script) | Path to the ground-truth clean CSV |
| `--save_path`     | `TestDataset/result/` | Directory where the cleaned CSV is written |
| `--table_name`    | `<dataset>` | Subfolder name + filename prefix for the cleaned CSV |
| `--index_col`     | `index`     | Name of the index column in your dirty/clean CSV. If different (e.g. `ID`) the scripts will rename it transparently |
| `--missing_token` | `empty`     | Placeholder string used to denote missing cells in the cleaned CSV (must match how your `clean.csv` represents missingness). See the *Important Note* above |

Example: cleaning a custom hospital-like dataset whose index column is `ID` and which uses the bare empty string as the missing marker:

```bash
python3 uniclean_cleaners/main_hospitals.py \
    --file_load   path/to/dirty.csv \
    --clean_path  path/to/clean.csv \
    --save_path   ./out/ \
    --table_name  myhospital \
    --index_col   ID \
    --missing_token ""
```
