    ### Welcome to UniClean, an advanced data cleaning framework designed to address the complexity and diversity in data cleaning processes.

    In the realm of data-intensive tasks, the quality of data is paramount. Yet, real-world data often comes with its flaws, encountering issues stemming from its diversity and the complexities of its applications. Traditional frameworks fall short, being too rigid to adapt to these challenges without extensive pre-existing data labels.

            The UniClean system is crafted to refine data set quality through specific cleaning targets, optimizing with precision and documenting the process for informed decision-making. It's built to adapt to the varied environments of large data sets, aiding business professionals in their decisions and comprehension.

            The architecture comprises two cleaning pipelines and models: the Cleaning Parameter Generation Pipeline (J), the Cleaning Parameter Selection Pipeline (K), the dynamic Quality Model (Q), and the Cleaning Decision Recommendation Model (M). This structure spans the entire process from adaptive strategy deployment to interpretive decision-making guidance.
